# Dirsort
CSC 370
This algorithm takes a String[] dirs as an input and
should sort dirs first by directory depth, and then
lexicographically for each depth. So "/d/e/" comes before
"/a/b/c/", but not before "/c/d/". Also, "/a/bc", comes
before "/ab/c", since "a" comes before "ab" in
lexicographical order.
